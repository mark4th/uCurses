uCurses library documentation at its lowest!

This  library  gives  you  the  ability  to  create applications with a very
powerful user interfaces.  It allows for moving, overlapping windows and for
all  characters to be drawn using either a normal color (over 200 paletitzed
colors usually), a gray scale from 0 to 23 or a full 24 bit RGB color.

The  foreground and background color types are independent so you can have a
gray scale background and a RGB foreground for example.  I.E.  Palette, gray
or RGB, pick two!

This code can be built with either LLVM or Gcc.  I prefer LLVM myself :)

NOTE!!!  Optimizing  this  codde for speed is not important and in fact wont
do much to help speed things up anyway because the enter library is heavilly
bound  to  the terminal I/O wihch is notoriously slow.  Even at -O0 the code
will  run perfectly fine even on older hardware so I have chosen to build it
to  be  as  small as I can possibly make it.  That is either with -Os or -Oz
which ever is suppored by the compiler.

To build this, from the root of the source tree do

        make
        sudo make install

The  make  install  will  copy the library files into /usr/local/lib64 after
which  you  should  be able to build with your applications with -l uCurses.
Dont forget to run ldconfig first!

To  build  the  example  code  cd into the example directory and run a make.
This will produce a file called demo which demonstrates various capabilities
of the library.  This is not exhaustive but creating it was exhausting :)

Documentation  for  how  to  use this library should be available soon.  The
example code should help but again, this is not exhaustive.  I have tried to
keep  the  library  as  simple  and  as  SMALL  as  possible  and  still  be
powerful  enough  for every day use.  There is a lot left to do however as I
am  not  yet playing well in certain terminal types. this will be fixed soon,
hopefully!
